# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Call some functions and execute code!

# This is very standard Python - it means
# "If this module is the one being executed, i.e., the main module"
# (as opposed to being imported by another module)
# Literally: "if this module name == the name of the main module"
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # call your functions here (see instructions)
    print("your code here")


# Why? Why only print if this the module called?
# Because when you write good functions, you may want to
# import this module into another script - just like you did
# math or statistics.
# Build a library of resuable functions to support your domain.

# For example, if your domain:
# Is sports, create functions to provide a list of teams.
# Is pets, create functions to calculate adoption prices.
# Is music, create functions to return a list of your favorite artists.


# When you write reusable functions for your domain, you can
# import the module with your utility functions into other modules
# and use them there.  This is a very common practice.
# Anything you write can be imported into later projects.
